# Wordpress Plugin for the PVTL ERP Sync Tool

This plugin provides a settings screen within the WP Admin area and also enables data to be synced to/from the ERP Sync Tool.


## Git Tags

Git will automatically tag a commit whenever a change to the version number is detected inside `erp-sync-tool.php`.

This behaviour is handled by `.github/workflows/version-update.yml`.
